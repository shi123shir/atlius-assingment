        <p><b>In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF)</b>&nbsp;literally means ‘fertilisation in glass’ giving us the familiar term ‘test tube baby’. During the IVF process, eggs are removed from the ovaries and fertilised with sperm in the laboratory. The fertilised egg (embryo) is later placed in the woman’s womb.
        <br /><br />
        Women has to receive daily injections either starting from day 18 of the previous cycle or on day 2 
        of the cycle depending on the type of protocol planned. The dosage and the number of injections will vary from person to person depending upon their response.
         Once the eggs are matured, the egg pick up will be planned(under GA). After the pickup, the embryos are transferred after 3 -5 days. The result of IVF cycle will be confirmed after 2 weeks from the day of embryo transfer
